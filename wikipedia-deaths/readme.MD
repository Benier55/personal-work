# Did more famous people than usual really die in 2016?

I analyzed this issue in an article published [here](http://dhmontgomery.com/2016/12/wikipediadeaths/).

In this repository you can find the data about Wikipedia death pages since 1990 in `deaths.csv`, the R script to create that database in `deathscraping.r`, and the R Markdown document for the [article](http://dhmontgomery.com/files/wikipediadeaths.html) in `wikipediadeaths.Rmd` which contains the ggplot code used to create the graphs.
